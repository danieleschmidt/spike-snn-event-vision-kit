## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Private Disclosure

**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@example.com
2. **Subject**: Use "[SECURITY] Spike-SNN Event Vision Kit - [Brief Description]"
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Security Considerations

This project processes event camera data and neural network models. Key security areas:

#### Data Security
- Event camera streams may contain sensitive visual information
- Ensure secure data transmission and storage
- Validate all input data formats

#### Model Security  
- Neural network models could contain embedded malicious code
- Only load models from trusted sources
- Validate model architectures and weights

#### Hardware Integration
- Neuromorphic chips and event cameras require secure drivers
- Validate hardware firmware and drivers
- Monitor for unusual hardware behavior

#### Network Security
- ROS2 integration exposes network interfaces
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Safe Usage Guidelines

#### For Developers
```python
# DO: Validate event data
def process_events(events):
    if not validate_event_format(events):
        raise SecurityError("Invalid event format")
    return process_safe_events(events)

# DON'T: Process untrusted event data directly
def unsafe_process(raw_data):
    return model.predict(raw_data)  # No validation!
```

#### For Model Loading
```python
# DO: Verify model source and checksum
model = SpikingYOLO.from_pretrained(
    "trusted_model",
    verify_checksum=True,
    allowed_sources=["official_repo"]
)

# DON'T: Load arbitrary models
model = torch.load("unknown_model.pth")  # Security risk!
```

#### For Hardware Integration
```python
# DO: Validate hardware connections
camera = DVSCamera(
    device="/dev/event0",
    verify_driver=True,
    secure_mode=True
)

# DON'T: Trust hardware blindly
camera = DVSCamera(device=user_input)  # Injection risk!
```

### Dependency Security

We regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities:

- **Automated**: Dependabot security updates
- **Manual**: Monthly security review of critical dependencies
- **Policy**: Auto-reject dependencies with known critical vulnerabilities

### Security Testing

Our security testing includes:

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL, Bandit for Python security issues
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scans
- **Fuzzing**: Input validation testing for event data parsing
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessment

### Disclosure Timeline

For accepted vulnerabilities:

1. **Private Fix**: Develop and test fix privately
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Notify affected users before public release
3. **Public Release**: Security advisory with CVE if applicable
4. **Recognition**: Credit reporter (with permission)

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we recognize security researchers in:

- Security advisories
- Release notes  
- Project documentation
- Conference presentations

### Security Best Practices

When using this toolkit:

#### Development Environment
- Use virtual environments for isolation
- Keep dependencies updated
- Enable security linting in CI/CD
- Regular security training for contributors

#### Production Deployment  
- Run with minimal required permissions
- Implement network segmentation
- Monitor for anomalous behavior
- Regular security updates and patches

#### Data Handling
- Encrypt sensitive event data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular data retention policy reviews
- Secure model storage and distribution
