# CI/CD Workflow Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for the spike-snn-event-vision-kit repository to achieve production-ready SDLC maturity.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Main CI/CD Pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests to main branch
- Scheduled daily runs

**Jobs:**
1. **Code Quality**
   - Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 matrix testing
   - Pre-commit hook validation
   - Code formatting (black)
   - Linting (flake8)
   - Type checking (mypy)
   - Import sorting (isort)

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Bandit security analysis
   - Safety vulnerability scanning
   - Secret detection
   - Dependency scanning
   - SBOM generation

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with pytest
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reporting (minimum 80%)
   - Performance regression tests

4. **Build & Package**
   - Build wheel and sdist
   - Docker image build and scan
   - Multi-architecture builds (amd64, arm64)

### 2. Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Schedule: Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Workflow dispatch (manual)
- Push to main (security files changed)

**Jobs:**
1. **CodeQL Analysis**
   - Static application security testing
   - Vulnerability detection
   - Security hotspot identification

2. **Container Security**
   - Trivy container scanning
   - Dockerfile best practices check
   - Base image vulnerability assessment

3. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Snyk vulnerability scanning
   - License compliance check
   - SBOM validation

### 3. Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Release please PR merge
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Jobs:**
1. **Semantic Release**
   - Automated version bumping
   - Changelog generation
   - Git tag creation

2. **Build & Publish**
   - PyPI package publishing
   - Docker image publishing to registry
   - GitHub release creation

3. **SBOM Generation**
   - Generate SPDX SBOM
   - Sign with Sigstore
   - Attach to release

### 4. Documentation Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to main (docs/ changes)
- Pull requests (docs/ changes)

**Jobs:**
1. **Build Docs**
   - Sphinx documentation build
   - Link checking
   - API documentation generation

2. **Deploy**
   - GitHub Pages deployment
   - Documentation versioning

## Workflow Templates

### CI Workflow Example Structure
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
    
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [quality]
    
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [test, security]
```

## Security Requirements

### Secret Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use OIDC for cloud provider authentication
- Never hardcode secrets in workflows

### Permissions
- Use least-privilege principle
- Explicitly declare required permissions
- Use `permissions: {}` when no permissions needed

### Artifact Security
- Sign all artifacts with Sigstore
- Generate and verify SBOMs
- Use trusted base images
- Scan all containers before deployment

## Compliance & Governance

### SLSA Compliance
- Level 2 SLSA compliance minimum
- Provenance generation for all artifacts
- Build isolation and auditability

### Audit Trail
- All workflow runs logged
- Deployment approvals tracked
- Security scan results archived

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Workflow Monitoring
- Failed workflow notifications
- Performance regression alerts
- Security vulnerability notifications

### Metrics Collection
- Build time tracking
- Test coverage trends
- Security posture scoring
- Deployment frequency metrics

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 (High Priority)**
   - Main CI/CD pipeline
   - Basic security scanning
   - Unit testing with coverage

2. **Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**
   - Advanced security workflows
   - Container scanning
   - SBOM generation

3. **Phase 3 (Enhancement)**
   - Performance testing
   - Advanced monitoring
   - Multi-environment deployments

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly workflow review
- Annual security assessment

### Performance Optimization
- Workflow run time optimization
- Parallel job execution
- Cache strategy implementation

**Note:** This repository cannot have GitHub Actions workflows created automatically. 
The maintainer must implement these workflows manually based on this specification.
