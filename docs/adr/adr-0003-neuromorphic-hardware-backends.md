# ADR-0003: Neuromorphic Hardware Backend Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

Neuromorphic hardware offers significant advantages for SNN deployment:
- **Intel Loihi 2**: 1 million neurons, 15-20x power efficiency
- **BrainChip Akida**: Commercial edge AI chip, 4-bit quantization
- **SpiNNaker**: Research platform, large-scale brain simulation
- **Future chips**: IBM TrueNorth successors, university prototypes

Challenges:
- Different programming models and toolchains
- Varying levels of PyTorch/ONNX support
- Access restrictions (Loihi requires NRC membership)
- Performance profiling and debugging complexity
- Model conversion and quantization requirements

## Decision

Implement **Multi-Backend Architecture** with:

1. **Backend Abstraction**: Common interface for different neuromorphic chips
2. **Progressive Deployment**: GPU → Loihi → Akida → Future chips
3. **Model Conversion Pipeline**: PyTorch → ONNX → Chip-specific formats
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation to GPU when hardware unavailable
5. **Performance Profiling**: Unified metrics across all backends

```python
class NeuromorphicBackend:
    def compile(model: SNNModel) -> CompiledModel
    def deploy(compiled: CompiledModel) -> DeployedModel
    def profile(model: DeployedModel) -> PerformanceMetrics
    def benchmark(model: DeployedModel, data: EventStream) -> BenchmarkResults
```

Priority order:
1. **CUDA/GPU**: Primary development and training platform
2. **Intel Loihi 2**: Ultra-low power deployment target
3. **BrainChip Akida**: Commercial edge deployment
4. **CPU Simulation**: Development fallback and CI testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- Flexibility to choose optimal hardware for deployment constraints
- Future-proof architecture for emerging neuromorphic chips
- Performance comparison across different platforms
- Risk mitigation if specific hardware becomes unavailable

### Negative
- Increased complexity in testing and validation
- Model optimization required for each backend
- Different quantization and precision requirements
- Potential performance variation across platforms

### Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: GPU baseline implementation
- Phase 2: Loihi 2 integration (if NRC access available)
- Phase 3: Akida commercial deployment support
- Phase 4: Generic neuromorphic backend for future chips

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain CPU fallback for all operations
- Use containerized environments for hardware abstraction
- Implement comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Document performance characteristics for each backend
