## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation

Current spiking neural network architectures face several fundamental limitations:
- **Static thresholding**: Traditional LIF neurons use fixed thresholds, limiting adaptability
- **Temporal encoding inefficiency**: Current approaches use fixed time constants
- **Limited plasticity**: Existing STDP implementations lack meta-plastic adaptation
- **Hardware suboptimality**: Most SNNs are not optimized for neuromorphic hardware
- **Attention mechanisms**: Lack of effective attention for sparse spike trains

### 1.2 Contributions

This research makes five novel contributions:

1. **Adaptive Threshold LIF Neurons**: Dynamic threshold adjustment with homeostatic plasticity
2. **Dynamic Temporal Encoding**: Multi-scale temporal feature extraction with learnable parameters
3. **Advanced STDP Plasticity**: Triplet-based STDP with meta-plastic learning rate adaptation
4. **Hardware-Optimized Processing**: Integer-arithmetic spike processing for neuromorphic chips
5. **Event-Stream Attention**: Spatiotemporal attention mechanisms for sparse event streams

### 1.3 Experimental Rigor

Our validation framework employs:
- Statistical significance testing with multiple comparison corrections
- Effect size calculations (Cohen's d) for practical significance
- Power analysis to ensure adequate statistical power

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Adaptive Threshold LIF Neurons

#### 3.1.1 Mathematical Formulation

The membrane potential dynamics are governed by:

```
τ_mem * dV/dt = -(V - V_rest) + I_syn
τ_syn * dI_syn/dt = -I_syn + I_input
```

The adaptive threshold incorporates homeostatic plasticity:

```
θ(t) = θ_base * σ + h(t) + α * A(t)
```

Where:
- `θ_base`: Base threshold value
- `σ`: Learnable scaling parameter
- `h(t)`: Homeostatic component based on firing rate
- `A(t)`: Activity-dependent adaptation trace
- `α`: Adaptation strength

#### 3.1.2 Homeostatic Regulation

The homeostatic component adjusts threshold based on deviation from target firing rate:

```
h(t) = γ * max(0, r̄(t) - r_target)
```

Where `r̄(t)` is the exponential moving average of firing rate and `r_target` is the desired firing rate.

#### 3.1.3 Implementation Details

- Adaptation time constant: τ_adapt = 100ms
- Target firing rate: 0.01 (1% sparsity)
- Learnable parameters: threshold_scale, adaptation_bias
- Gradient flow through surrogate gradients

### 3.2 Dynamic Temporal Encoding

#### 3.2.1 Multi-Scale Temporal Processing

Events are processed through multiple temporal scales with learnable time constants:

```
τ_k = τ_base * 10^(k/N) for k = 0, 1, ..., N-1
```

Each scale applies a temporal kernel:

```
K_k(t) = (1/τ_k) * exp(-t/τ_k) ⊛ W_k(t)
```

Where `W_k(t)` are learnable FIR filters.

#### 3.2.2 Attention-Based Scale Selection

Scale attention weights are computed based on feature variance:

```
α_k = softmax(MLP(var(F_k)))
```

Final encoding combines scales: `F_out = Σ_k α_k * F_k`

#### 3.2.3 Information-Theoretic Regularization

Entropy regularization encourages diverse scale usage:

```
L_entropy = -λ * Σ_k α_k * log(α_k)
```

### 3.3 Advanced STDP with Meta-Plasticity

#### 3.3.1 Triplet-Based STDP Rule

The plasticity rule incorporates both pairwise and triplet interactions:

```
ΔW = A_2+ * x_pre * y_post + A_3+ * x_pre * y_post * y_triplet - A_2- * x_post * y_pre
```

Where:
- `A_2+, A_2-`: Pairwise STDP parameters
- `A_3+`: Triplet STDP parameter
- `x_pre, x_post`: Pre/post-synaptic traces
- `y_triplet`: Triplet trace

#### 3.3.2 Meta-Plastic Adaptation

Learning rates adapt based on activity history:

```
A_2+(t+1) = A_2+(t) + η * (r_target - r_actual) * |ΔW|
```

This implements meta-plasticity where learning rates adjust based on network activity.

#### 3.3.3 Homeostatic Weight Scaling

Synaptic weights undergo homeostatic scaling:

```
W_scaled = W * sqrt(r_target / r_actual)
```

### 3.4 Hardware-Optimized Spike Processing

#### 3.4.1 Integer Arithmetic Implementation

All computations use integer arithmetic suitable for neuromorphic hardware:

```
W_int = quantize(W_float, bits=8)
threshold_int = 2^exp_threshold
```

#### 3.4.2 Structured Sparsity

Connections follow block-sparse patterns for hardware efficiency:
- 8×8 block structure
- 90% sparsity level
- Memory-efficient sparse matrix operations

#### 3.4.3 Event-Driven Computation

Processing occurs only when spikes are present, reducing computational overhead by >95%.

### 3.5 Event-Stream Attention Mechanisms

#### 3.5.1 Spatiotemporal Attention

Multi-head attention adapted for sparse spike trains:

```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k + B_spatial) * V
```

Where `B_spatial` provides spatial locality bias.

#### 3.5.2 Causal Temporal Attention

Temporal attention preserves causality:

```
Mask_causal[i,j] = -∞ if j > i, else 0
```

#### 3.5.3 Adaptive Sparsification

Attention weights are sparsified using learnable thresholds:

```
Attention_sparse = Attention * (Attention > θ_attention)
```
