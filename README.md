# spike-snn-event-vision-kit
spike-snn-event-vision-kit provides a complete framework for deploying spiking neural networks on event-based vision systems. Building on the 2024 review showing SNNs outperform frame-based CNNs on latency and energy, this toolkit enables real-time, ultra-low-power vision processing for robotics and edge AI applications.
